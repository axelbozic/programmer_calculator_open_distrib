This is a hexadeciaml-binary-decimal converter (in developmental stage).
This calculator is targeted towards aspiring programmers (I'm a newbie as well).
If you don't understand what binary or hexadecimal is, feel free to mess around.
This calculator can take values as long as the Microsoft Programmmer Calculator.
Going above 64 digits in binary, 15 digits in hexadecimal, and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 in decimal will send the program in an error state.
This is because our computers can only process up to 64 bits.
There will be future updates that will focus more on restricting the user input over a certain value.


When you download the zip file, you must extract it to your desired location. 
Running the .exe file without extraction may cause the app to not run.
If you're using chrome, the browser might show you a warning when downloading but there's nothing to worry about.
After extracting the file, run the open_distrib.exe application.
Usually, before the first run, your computer might show you a warning with an option that says "don't run", don't click that.
Click on "see more" and then you'll see "run anyway".
Click on "run anyway" and you're set.
